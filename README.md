# Assignment 1 - Point3D Class and Strings
 
## Overview
For this task, you are required to create a function declaration within a class named Point3D andTriangle in the Ex1/headers/Point3D.h, Ex1/headers/Triangle.h files. The purpose of this class is to encapsulate the representation of a point within three-dimensional space.
 
# Assignment 2: Character Functions
 
## Overview
This project encompasses a C++ function designed to yield a std::string containing a specific message.
 
# Assignment3: File Handling in C++ Part1
 
## Overview
 
This task requires the utilization of file handling in C++ for reading and processing triangle data from a file. The implementation is divided into two files: Reader.cpp and Writer.cpp. The tasks involve employing the getline() function, utilizing istringstream for string parsing, creating instances of Point3D, and populating a vector with Triangle objects.
 
# Assignment4: File Handling in C++ Part2
 
## Overview
This assignment implementing file handling in C++ to read and process triangle data from a file, with the implementation divided into two files: Reader.cpp and Writer.cpp. The specified tasks involve employing the getline() function, utilizing istringstream for string parsing, creating instances of Point3D, and populating a vector with Triangle objects. Additionally, the assignment includes the specific instruction to read only the vertex values from a .stl file.
 
# Assignment 5: Implementation of Lambda Function
 
## Overview
 Within this assignment, a lambda expression named displayFileNotFound has been incorporated in the Reader.cpp and Writer.cpp file. The objective of this lambda expression is to deliver a message indicating the absence of the specified file.
 
# Assignment 6: Implementation of Lambda Function with capture clause and mutable.
 
## Overview
Within the context of this assignment, there exists a lambda expression named displayFileNotFound in the Reader.cpp and Writer.cpp file. Notably, this lambda expression incorporates a capture clause and utilizes the mutable keyword. Its fundamental purpose is to articulate a message that denotes the absence of the designated file.
 
# Assignment 7: Genralized capture with initialization
 
## Overview
In this assignment, a lambda expression named displayFileNotFound has been implemented in the Reader.cpp and Writer.cpp file with Genralized capture with initialization.The purpose of this lambda expression is to provide a message indicating that the file was not found.
 
# Assignment 8 - Implementation of Iterators.
 
## Overview
This assignment is centered around utilizing iterators to showcase vertex points on the console and write the vertex to file. The primary objective is to define an iterator type for a vector of triangles and then iterate through the vector to display the coordinates of each vertex.
 
# Assignment 9 - Implemetation of sequential containers List, Vector, Deque
 
## Overview
 
This assignment involves use of sequential containers such as list, vector and deque.
 
# Assignment 10 - Implemetation of sequential container Deque Part2
 
## Overview
 
This assignment involves use of sequential container deque and string concatenation.
 
# Assignment 11 - Implemetation of sequential container Deque Part2
 
## Overview
 
This assignment focuses on the utilization of the std::map container in C++ STL. In the /headers/Triangulation.h file, a std::map<Triangle, double> tArea is declared to store pairs of Triangle objects and their Areas. The container is populated using the void Triangulation::   setArea() function. Additionally, two methods are available to retrieve and print the Areas.
 
# Assignment 12: Implementation of virtual function.
 
## Overview
In this assignment, implemented inheritance with virtual function.
 
# Assignment 13 - Implementation of Interfacing of C++ functions with C code.
## Overview
This assignment involves using C code to implement specific part of the program. This is applicable for most of the languages just the keywords or the methods can be different. The objective is to make the program faster by directly treating a part code as C program.
The objective is to make the program faster by directly treating a part code as **C** program.
